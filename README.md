# COVID-19-Data-Hub
Data Science &amp; Visualization project analyzing COVID-19 trends in India using real-world datasets from Our World in Data — includes cases, deaths, and vaccination insights.

OVID-19 Data Visualization (India) is a Data Science and Visualization (DSV) project that focuses on analyzing and visualizing the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in India using real-time data from Our World in Data (OWID).

The project explores how infection rates, death counts, and vaccination progress evolved from 2020 to 2023, highlighting major pandemic waves like Delta and Omicron. It demonstrates the power of data analytics and visualization in transforming raw epidemiological data into meaningful insights that support public health awareness and decision-making.

Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the project produces clean, easy-to-understand charts that show:

The cumulative rise in total confirmed cases

Daily new case trends (7-day rolling average)

Total COVID-19 deaths over time

India’s vaccination progress and its impact

The results showcase how effective visualization can uncover key insights from massive datasets and help communicate real-world patterns clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.
